# Scholarly

## Introduction
Welcome to the Scholarly project! This project is an innovative venture in the fields of Software Engineering. It focuses on developing advanced solutions using Natural Language Processing (NLP), chatbot technology, and summarization tools. Our goal is to explore the intersection of these technologies to create impactful, user-friendly applications.


## Project Objectives
The main objective of the Scholarly project is to harness the power of NLP and related technologies to build software tools that can simplify complex tasks. This includes:
- Developing a robust chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user queries effectively.
- Creating an NLP-driven summarizer and flashcard generator to aid in learning and information processing.

## Team Members
Our team comprises talented individuals with diverse backgrounds in Software Engineering and Finance:

- **Abhay Khosla**: Software Engineering
- **Ahad Ali**: Software Engineering and Finance
- **Arian Haghighat**: Majoring in Finance with an embedded certificate in   entrepreneurship.
- **Jacob Lansang**: Software Engineering with a Minor in Mechatronics
- **Mushtaba Al Yasseen**: Software Engineering and Finance

## Project Components
**NLP**
Focusing on leveraging NLP for various applications, including text analysis and language-driven interfaces.
**Chatbot**
A sophisticated chatbot designed to interact intelligently with users, enhancing user experience and providing efficient query resolution.
**Summarizer + Flash Cards**
An innovative tool that uses NLP to summarize content and create flashcards, aimed at improving learning and information retention.

## How to run the application 
### Run Backend
1. Go into backend folder: `cd backend`
2. Create and enter python virtual env (for Windows/CMD): `py -3 -m venv venv`
3. `.\\venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install dependencies/packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run application: `flask run`

Note: For Mac for steps 2-3 use [this](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/). Also steps 2-3 are optional.

### Run Frontend
1. Go into frontend folder (in new terminal): `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Run application: `npm start`
